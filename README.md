Create a chatbot to automatically collect the basic info and specific requirement from clients for creating a smart home solution, the chatbot can also help with general Q&A around this topic

##1. Convert the Decision Tree into Training Data
Since you already have a clear decision tree, the next step is to transform it into a structured dataset that the model can learn from. Here’s how:
###1.1 Create Dialogue Scenarios: Convert each path in your decision tree into a series of question-answer pairs or dialogue sequences that represent an ideal conversation flow.
use the [generate_dialogue_template.py](https://github.com/yagebin79386/chatbot-smart-home/blob/357afb54df7613f55e4d610b32bd3be5b10078f7/generate_dialogue_template.py) to generate the dialogue template for general individual information in json formate.


	• Include Relevant Q&A Data for Smart Home and IoT: Gather or create Q&A pairs about smart home and IoT topics to supplement the training data. This will help the model answer relevant questions it encounters during the conversation.
	• Format Data for Training: Each dialogue can be represented as input-output pairs in a JSON or CSV format, such as:
		○ Input: "User: I’m interested in setting up a smart thermostat. AI: Great! Do you already have any existing smart devices?"
		○ Output: "User: Yes, I have a smart speaker."


##2. Fine-Tune GPT-2 with the Custom Dataset
Once the dataset is ready, you can proceed with fine-tuning the model:
	• Prepare the Training Environment: Use libraries like Hugging Face’s Transformers, which make it easy to fine-tune models with custom datasets. Install the necessary libraries and set up your environment.
	• Tokenize the Data: Preprocess the dataset by tokenizing the text to prepare it for training. The Transformers library has tokenizers that work well with GPT-2.
	• Fine-Tune the Model: Use the Trainer API in Hugging Face to fine-tune GPT-2 on your dataset. Set appropriate training parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs to optimize performance. Monitor training to avoid overfitting.


##3. Implement the Decision Tree Logic in Post-Processing
LLMs may not always follow strict decision paths, so you can enhance control by implementing the decision tree as a post-processing layer:
	• Custom Logic Layer: Wrap the model’s outputs in custom logic that enforces the decision tree. For instance, after each response, check the user’s answer and decide the next question based on your decision tree.
	• Dynamic Question Flow: Based on the response, dynamically adjust the next question rather than relying entirely on the model. This ensures that the decision tree structure is strictly followed.


##4. Combine with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Domain Knowledge
To handle domain-specific queries about smart home and IoT:
	• Add a Retrieval Component: Use a RAG pipeline, where the model can query a knowledge base for smart home/IoT information. This can be implemented with an open-source solution like Haystack or by integrating a document search API to retrieve relevant information.
	• Hybrid Pipeline: Combine the decision-tree-guided questioning with RAG-based answering. When a client asks a general question, the model can retrieve relevant information and provide a well-informed response.
